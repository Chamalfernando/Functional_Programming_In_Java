Pure Functional Programming has a set of rules to follow.

1). No State

2). Pure Functions - these don't depend on global state. Those should self contained.

3). No Side Effects - No side effects other than everything inside the body of your function.

4). Higher Order Functions
----- The function takes one or more functions as parameters.
----- The function returns another function as result.(refer to callbacks,combinator patter)
